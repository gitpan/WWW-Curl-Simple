          - fatal: (defaults to true), if false, will carp, not croak, on errors.

        Set a default UserAgent header, since some services seem to require a
        UserAgent header.

        INCOMPAT: Fix some compat issues with LWP::Parallel::UserAgent.
                  We now return an hash like they do, with objects that have the
                  same methods
        INCOMPAT: $curl->perform on a multi-request now returns objects that have
                  ->request and ->response methods, instead of the ->response
                  directly.
        
        Fix really bad response-fuckup.
